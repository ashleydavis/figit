# Steps to creating an open source project

1. Choose a name (or choose it later! Naming is hard.)
2. Create your project (npm init -y or use a template)
3. Install initial dependencies.
4. Create your repo (git init, I always like to commit early)
   1. Have a .gitignore
   2. Have a good readme! (but this is more important a bit later)
5. Create your repo on GitHub and push
6. Code code code.
7. Publish your package on npm.
   1. Have an .npmignore
   2. Review settings in your package.json
   3. Add a build process if necessary (prepublish step in package.json, eg build TypeScript code)
   4. Have a good readme!
   5. How to bundle a CLI app.
8. Iterate!
9.  Maintenance (look at GH issues on my project Data-Forge).
10. Make a web page (optional, you can host it under GitHub pages, can show Plot).
